                <div class = "indiv-heading">Overview</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">This year, I had the opportunity to take a 7-week course about Assistive Technology, where we learned from an Occupational Therapist (and AT specialist) and worked with some of her past disabled patients to design and develop an AT of our choice. </div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">After talking to one of her patients, Andy, and his love for cooking before he became paralyzed from Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN), my group of 4 wanted to help him achieve his goals by making him an adapted stove knob handle for our final project.</div>

            <!-- <section class = "step"> -->
                <div class = "indiv-heading">Defining the Problem</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">Andy's exact disability after recovering from complete paralysis is impaired mobility and strength in his wrists and hands (his left hand has some more mobility, and his right hand is fixed in one position, while neither of his wrists could rotate over roughly 50 degrees). </div>
                <div class = "indiv-body"><b>The main challenge with turning on the stove was simultaneously gripping the handle, pushing the knob inwards, and rotating it.</b></div>

                <div class = "indiv-heading">Research</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">Looking at existing AT that tackles this issue, we weren't able to find many, but the ones that were available online all required some sort of wrist turning and strength. The main areas they tackled seemed to just be increasing the grip size so that the whole hand can be used instead of just the fingers, or extending the reach of the stove knobs for those that are positioned in the back area as shown below. Moreover, the handles all seemed to have potential balance issues as the center of force for pushing the knob inwards were all pointing to the top of the knob.</div>

                <div class = "indiv-heading">Ideation</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">We all did our sketches individually and met on zoom to discuss our ideas over the Miro platform. We gave feedback to each one, asking questions in the process to ensure that issues were addressed or recognized before we took any further action.</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">We started off thinking about bigger knob handles that would be easier to grip (with the whole hand instead of just fingers). We thought that this larger grip would allow for the simultaneous motion of the body pushing the knob inwards and the hand rotating it (or two using two hands). However, this design still seemed like it would be challenging for Andy to rotate it completely. So we started to think about alternative ways, keeping in mind some existing handles that we could replicate here.</div>

                <div class = "indiv-heading">Prototyping - Moldable Plastic</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">We started prototyping with the WhiteMorph moldable plastic to bring our sketches to life. We chose this medium due to its fast drying time (which we then realized was slightly problematic as we had to work very fast). After creating each mold shown above, we tested it on the stove knob to see if it was easy to use, mimicking Michael's condition to better understand how he might use it himself. This was critical to helping us make decisions and eliminate a few designs. We met up as a group twice for a few hours each during this stage of the process.</div>

                <div class = "indiv-heading">Prototyping - 3D Printing</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">After trying out the moldable plastic, we felt that the products didn't seem super smooth or nice looking for everyday use. Moreover, we knew that 3D-printed products were generally lighter in weight. During this stage of the process, a groupmate and I took on the role of 3D modeling on TinkerCad, while the others went to the NYU MakerSpace to print out a model. We modeled 4 different adapted stove knob handles to scale, but due to the limited time and materials, we could only choose one to print, which was decided in a group chat via a vote. In this stage of the process, we also found out that most stove knob handles are detachable, meaning that we would be able to eliminate the issue of stability in our original attachment designs. However, due to limited time and testing, we chose not to pursue this idea. As stove knob handles vary in size, and we couldn't get the measurements of Michael's stove knob, we made sure that the models were all very adjustable online.</div>

                <div class = "indiv-body">Because of limited time and studio availability, we had to choose only one design to print. And so, based on testing, we decided on the T-shaped door handle design as it separates the motions of pushing and turning the knob so that Michael doesn’t have to rotate his wrist so much. The choice of the T-shape was also to accommodate for both different stove knobs that turn in different ways.</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">Once we finished printing our final design, we found that the sizing wasn't exactly correct and that the base bath didn’t go smoothly (hence the rough bits stuck on), so we used a knife to scrape it down so it would better fit the knob handle we had. We decided on this design as it separates the motions of pushing and turning the knob so that Michael doesn’t have to rotate his wrist so much.</div>

                        <li>Because there is no adhesive/grip to the part where it attaches to the stove knob handle, holding it up to the knob might be an issue.</li>
                        <li>Stove knobs differ in size and shape, so we hope this can work for Michael's kitchen. The online designs are easily adjustable, so it is okay if the one we printed does not work out.</li>
                        <li>We couldn't do user testing directly with Michael during the design process, so we couldn't be 100% sure that this was the best design for him.</li>
