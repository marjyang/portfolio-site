                <div class = "indiv-heading">Overview</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">During my Junior year of college this year, I had the opportunity to take a 7-week course about Assistive Technology, where we learned from an Occupational Therapist (and AT specialist) and worked with some of her past disabled patients to design and develop an AT for a purpose of our choice. </div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">After hearing about Andy's love for cooking before he became paralyzed from Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN), my group of 4 wanted to help him achieve that first step to get back into cooking by making an adapted stove knob handle for our final project.</div>

                <div class = "indiv-heading">Defining the Problem</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">Andy's exact disability after recovering from complete paralysis is impaired mobility and strength in his wrists and hands (his left hand has some more mobility, and his right hand is fixed in one position, while neither of his wrists could rotate over roughly 50 degrees). </div>
                <div class = "indiv-body"><b>The main challenge with turning on the stove was simultaneously gripping the handle, pushing the knob inwards, and rotating it.</b></div>

                <div class = "indiv-heading">Research</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">Looking at existing AT that tackles this issue, we weren't able to find many, but the ones that were available online all required some sort of wrist turning and strength. The main areas they tackled seemed to just be increasing the grip size so that the whole hand can be used instead of just the fingers, or extending the reach of the stove knobs for those that are positioned in the back area as shown below. Moreover, the handles all seemed to have potential balance issues as the center of force for pushing the knob inwards were all pointing to the top of the knob.</div>

                <div class = "indiv-heading">Ideation</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">We all did our sketches individually and met on zoom to discuss our ideas over the Miro platform. We gave feedback to each one, asking questions in the process to ensure that issues were addressed or recognized before we took any further action.</div>
                <div class = "col-2">
                    <div class = "indiv-body">We started off thinking about bigger knob handles that would be easier to grip (with the whole hand instead of just fingers). We thought that this larger grip would allow for the simultaneous motion of the body pushing the knob inwards and the hand rotating it (or two using two hands). However, this design still seemed like it would be challenging for Andy to rotate it completely. So we started to think about alternative ways, keeping in mind some existing handles that we could replicate here.</div>

                <div class = "indiv-heading">Prototyping - Moldable Plastic</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">We started with using the WhiteMorph moldable plastic to bring our sketches to life. We chose this medium due to its fast drying time (which we then realized was slightly problematic as we had to work very fast). After creating each mold shown above, we tested it on the stove knob to see if it was easy to use, mimicking Michael's condition to better understand how he might use it himself. This was critical to helping us make decisions and eliminate a few designs. We met up as a group twice for a few hours each during this stage of the process.</div>

                <div class = "indiv-heading">Prototyping - 3D Printing</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">After trying out the moldable plastic, we felt that the products didn't seem super smooth or nice looking for everyday use. Moreover, we knew that 3D-printed products were generally lighter in weight. During this stage of the process, a groupmate and I took on the role of 3D modeling on TinkerCad, while the others went to the NYU MakerSpace to print out a model. We modeled 4 different adapted stove knob handles to scale, but due to the limited time and materials, we could only choose one to print, which was decided in a group chat via a vote. In this stage of the process, we also found out that most stove knob handles are detachable, meaning that we would be able to eliminate the issue of stability in our original attachment designs. However, due to limited time and testing, we chose not to pursue this idea. As stove knob handles vary in size, and we couldn't get the measurements of Michael's stove knob, we made sure that the models were all very adjustable online.</div>
                <div class = "indiv-body">Once we finished printing our final design, we found that the sizing wasn't exactly correct, so we used a knife to sand it down so it would better fit the knob handle we had. The below video shows our demonstration of how to use it. We decided on this design as it separates the motions of pushing and turning the knob so that Michael doesnâ€™t have to rotate his wrist so much. More modifications, such as making the pushing surface area larger, adding more grippy material on the handle, and making sure the printed model was smooth, would have made this design better.</div>
