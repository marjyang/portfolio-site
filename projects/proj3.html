            <div class = "indiv-heading">Background</div>
            <div class = "indiv-body">New York's sea level has risen 9 inches since 1950 due to global carbon emissions, and as of 2018, New York was recorded as the third-largest city contributor - amassing a grave footprint on global warming. Since then, in 2019, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the Lower Manhattan Coastal Resiliency Project. Early in 2022, Rutgers professor Jason Barr proposed an expansion of NYC, "New Mannahatta" as a single solution to both the growing housing crisis and climate threats. Aside from adaptive plans, NYC is working on transitioning energy systems from fossil fuels to renewable energy as well as its corresponding socio-economic policies to make a direct impact on climate change itself. The city has become a role model for environment-focused governance across the United States.</div>
            <div class = "indiv-body">However, NYC is certainly still miles away from the net-zero carbon target by 2050, and the urgency of the situation has caused grave concern for environmental injustice and climate apartheid. Our team believes that with the right mindsets and actions from residents, business owners, and policy-makers, carbon neutrality is in no doubt achievable.</div>
            <div class = "indiv-body"><i>Rising</i> is an immersive roleplaying experience that aims to educate users about the impact of US carbon emissions on sea level rise - more particularly, the impact of specific actions made by different socio-economic roles.</div>

            <div class = "indiv-heading">Gameplay</div>
            <div class = "indiv-body">The game requires five players, each representing a socio-economic group residing in the US: working class citizens, middle class citizens, higher class citizens, corporations, and policymakers.</div>
            <div class = "indiv-body">The main actions from the five players involve tapping action cards (relating to emissions) on a card reader as the rounds progress. Their actions are then incrementally analysed to determine the sea level rise and glacial melting feedback which is then shown on a projection. The story begins in 2022, each round represents two years passing by, and once 2042 is reached, the a summary and point system is revealed to all players so they can see what went wrong, and take the time to reflect.</div>

            <div class = "indiv-heading">Reflection</div>
            <div class = "indiv-body">Reflecting on the project, our making process, and the exhibition feedback, we thought it went really well, and that we were able to figure out the bugs that we encountered near the end on time. The development part of the process was definitely one of the most challenging tasks to complete - especially with making sure the three-way connection (between the Python program, Unity, and Arduino Uno) was smooth and was working. For future modifications, we would do more user testing to find how different types of players with different dynamics with one another might affect how impactful the experience is for them, and see how this research can in turn improve our design. Additionally, moving the physical experience to a digital one will make it more accessible.</div>

            <div class = "caption">Rising was funded by the NYU Green Grant Program, and was displayed in NYU Bobst Library for the environmental awareness exhibition, *This is Not A Drill* (exhibition on Technology, Equity, and the Climate Emergency), until Winter of 2022. Alongside, the project was accepted for the Design for Adaptation Program, Cumulus Detroit 2022, where we presented our research in their annual conference November of 2022.</div>
