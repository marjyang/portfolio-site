            <div class = "indiv-heading">Background</div>
            <div class = "indiv-body">New York's sea level has risen 9 inches since 1950 due to global carbon emissions, and as of 2018, New York was recorded as the third-largest city contributor - amassing a grave footprint on global warming. Since then, in 2019, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the Lower Manhattan Coastal Resiliency Project. Early in 2022, Rutgers professor Jason Barr proposed an expansion of NYC, "New Mannahatta" as a single solution to both the growing housing crisis and climate threats. Aside from adaptive plans, NYC is working on transitioning energy systems from fossil fuels to renewable energy as well as its corresponding socio-economic policies to make a direct impact on climate change itself. The city has become a role model for environment-focused governance across the United States.</div>
            <div class = "indiv-body">However, NYC is certainly still miles away from the net-zero carbon target by 2050, and the urgency of the situation has caused grave concern for environmental injustice and climate apartheid. Our team believes that with the right mindsets and actions from residents, business owners, and policy-makers, carbon neutrality is in no doubt achievable.</div>
