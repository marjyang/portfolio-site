        <p class = "desc">Rising is an immersive roleplaying experience that aims to educate users about the impact of US carbon emissions on sea level rise - more particularly, the impact of specific actions made by different socio-economic roles. Rising was funded by the NYU Tisch Summer Grant Program, and is now displayed in NYU Bobst Library for the environmental awareness exhibition, *This is Not A Drill*, until Winter of 2022. Alongside, the data research from the project was nominated as a top candidate for the Design for Adaptation Program in Cumulus Detroit, and team members will be presenting in their annual conference this upcoming November.</p>
