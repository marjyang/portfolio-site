            <p class = "desc"><i>Rising</i> is an immersive roleplaying experience that aims to educate users about the impact of US carbon emissions on sea level rise - more particularly, the impact of specific actions made by different socio-economic roles. Rising was funded by the NYU Tisch Summer Grant Program, and is now displayed in NYU Bobst Library for the environmental awareness exhibition, *This is Not A Drill*, until Winter of 2022. Alongside, the project was accepted for the Design for Adaptation Program, Cumulus Detroit 2022, where team members and I will be presenting our research in their annual conference this November.</p>
